  <h1>Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Website Reviews</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>This project focuses on sentiment analysis of customer reviews from an e-commerce website, aiming to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments. Two machine learning classifiers, <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> and <strong>Naive Bayes</strong>, were implemented to achieve this task. The project leverages <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> techniques and achieved a recall score of <strong>93.6% with Naive Bayes</strong> and <strong>86.4% with Logistic Regression</strong> using TF-IDF vectorization.</p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>Understanding customer sentiments from reviews is crucial for e-commerce businesses. As the volume of reviews increases, manual analysis becomes time-consuming. This project explores the application of AI tools to transform lengthy reviews into concise summaries, enabling businesses to quickly grasp customer preferences.</p>
